# Terraform Module

## What is Terraform Module?
A Terraform module is a set of Terraform configuration files in a single directory. Even a simple configuration consisting of a single directory with one or more .tf files is a module. When you run Terraform commands directly from such a directory, it is considered the root module. So in this sense, every Terraform configuration is part of a module.
